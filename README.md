#Introduction

This is a malware I found in my chrome extension. 

It pops a lot of ads and also injects ads into the page I read.

The interesting part is that I cannot simply delete it from Chrome > Settings > Extensions > Remove from Chrome.

#How to Install

Copy `ianjjcfimdmohdpdolcckgelkmcpoojk` to your Chrome extension directory.

For instance your Chrome extension directory may be,

Windows 8: `C:\User\YourName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions`

Ubuntu 14.04: `/home/YourName/.config/google-chrome/Default/Extensions/`

#How to Uninstall

Remove the directory you copied in Chrome extension directory.
